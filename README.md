# Transit as a Community of Interest 
This project uses data from the ACS 5-year survey and from the MTA's Transit Survey to argue that public transit riders in New York City constitute a community of interest. The data and analysis was assembled into a term paper that is hosted on Quarto

## Organization 
Repo needs to be cleaned. At the moment NYC Redistricting contains the data, the r markdown files, and the quarto app. The data folder has an MTA folder which contains .csvs from them and several shapeile folders, primarily of the city, city council districts, subway and bus stops. All census data was accessed using the census api in the markdown file.
